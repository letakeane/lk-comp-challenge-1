### lk-comp-challenge-1

-----

#### Overview
This is the first of three exercises in turning a static comp into a resopnsive site (html & css only).

The original comp (see below) was for a desktop view. The challenge was concerned with layout and left the colors, assets, and text open to interpretation.

Below are a series of my version, which I themed as a tourism website for Night Vale (the fictional town from the hit podcast [Welcome to Night Vale](http://www.welcometonightvale.com/)).
